// L06 Step 1: Change ViewController name to something more specific
class FaceViewController: VCLLoggingViewController {
    // Step 1. Create an outlet for the view
    @IBOutlet weak var faceView: FaceView!
    // Step 6: Another place to update UI is here
    // It's less obvious but needed. Why?
    // My answer: when the outlet is first being set we need to make sure the UI matches the model
    // Professor's answer:
    // Reason 1: in the short amount of time when the outlet is not hooked by iOS yet, what if the model gets set?
    // then updateUI is not going to work because faceView hasn't been connected yet
    // My understanding of professor's talk: So after it's connected, make sure the UI is updated to match model.
    // Reason 2: expression 's didSet will not be called when it's being initialized (only called when it's set)
    // Another problem is that what if expression gets set before the faceView is hooked? updateUI() is going to crash because faceView is nil.
    // Solution: Use optional chaining in the updateUI for faceView.
    // This is often something you want to do in your updateUI thing: Protecting against your outlets not being set.
